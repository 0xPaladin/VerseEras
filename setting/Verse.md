# Verse Setting

## The Verse is…

Cosmic. The Verse spans an entire galaxy. Powerful factions control numerous systems and worlds. Megastructures are common. Travel between worlds is prevalent and quick.
Baroque. Construction, clothes, and societies are extravagant.
Pulp. Larger than life characters and action.  
Science Fantasy. Magic and tech are blended, indistinguishable from one another, omni-present and ingrained.  
Cthulhu-punk. Lovecraft inspired alien Ancients and their thrall minions inhabit and tyrannically rule a lot of the galaxy. Humanoids are treated like expendable tools. Most action will focus on saving humanity from the Ancients and rebelling against their tyrannical rule.
Optimistic. Even though the Ancients are prevalent, the Celestials stand to oppose them and offer hope. Countless systems of former slaves live free lives, and the desire to see more people free burns bright.
My inspiration was…
Planescape. A RPG setting written by many authors published by Wizards of the Coast. Plane-hopping adventures with gods, angels, demons, and mythical locations.
The Culture. A series of books by Iain M. Banks. Awesome science fiction about far-future transhumanity, godlike AI and galactic scale adventure.
Lovecraft. All of his works feature alien horrors with little regard for human-kind. These horrors make the perfect villains.
Illium/Olympos. Books by Dan Simmons. Far future, fake gods on Mars, post-apocalyptic Earth, and sentient machines in the outer solar system.
Jupiter Ascending. A space opera film by the Wachowskis. Not the best film, but definitely epic, cosmic and baroque.
Stargate. The whole franchise: movie and multiple TV series. World hopping aliens with far future tech playing gods with humans.
Dune. A series of books by Frank Herbert, and there are a couple of movie versions. The Dune setting is rich with the baroque atmosphere. The houses and factions and their plays for power are epic.

## The Verse Galaxy

Galaxies are huge. The Verse is roughly 100,000 light years (ly) in diameter but only 1,000 ly thick at spiral arms (10,000 at the center bulge). It contains 200 - 500 billion stars and just as many planets. The major factions divide the galaxy into 1000 light-year cubic sectors and further divide sectors into 100 light-year cubic subsectors.
Rough statistics for the Verse:
Sector Count: 7854
Subsector Count: 7,854,000
Sector Star Count: 25 - 64 million
Subsector Star Count: 25,000 - 64,000
Habitable Worlds per Subsector: 25-250

## Quick Glossary

Ancient. The Ancients is the group term for the species and civilizations that have dominated regions of the galaxy for over 80,000 years. Their origins are unknown and their home systems are lost.  
AI. Artificial Intelligence. The Ancients as a whole do not use technology and they do not trust AI, sentient or otherwise.
Capitals. Great interstellar craft that - at a minimum - haul thousands of people and hundreds of thousands of tons of cargo. Size is not a factor, capitals hundreds of miles long swim through space like interstellar whales.
Celestials. The group term for the benevolent civilizations and factions of the Verse. They cooperate through a loose organization called the Free Union.
Conduits. A network of hyperspace currents that allows for FTL travel that is 10 to 100 times faster than standard.
Cosmics. Beings beyond the capabilities of even the Ancients. They are capable of miraculous effects at solar system scale at a minimum.
Precursors. Those species that came before the Ancients, but have now left the Verse for one reason or another. Their ruins can be found in countless systems throughout the Verse and the relics of their technology and knowledge are treasures.
Gate. These devices allow instantaneous travel between it and another place. Most can only achieve travel between a few dozen light years, but the Crysik are capable of building gates that can span hundreds of light years. Ancient gate travel is detrimental to panhumanity - extensive use will cause mutation and drive most insane.
Feral System: These systems used to be claimed by Ancients, but it has either rebelled, or the Ancients simply forgot about it. Things may be in utter chaos, or the thralls may have established their own order, anything is possible. Most have very limited technology.  
Hyperspace. A method of travel where a ship jumps from normal-space to hyperspace where faster than light (FTL) speeds are possible. The mass of a ship increases the energy required to remain in hyperspace, so the larger the ship the slower it can go. Most Celestial small ships can achieve a FTL speed of ~10 light years per day while Neutral faction ships are limited to ~5 light years per day. .
Managed System: Claimed by an Ancient, but they are not actually present. These systems are managed by high ranking thralls. Panhuman settlements are always enslaved and suppressed technologically.
Orbital: A constructed spinning ring in space. The inner surface is habitable and terraformed to look like a terrestrial world. Many orbitals have a circumference of ~10 million kilometers and a width between 4-12 kilometers. This gives even the smallest an area equivalent to ~40 Earths.
Panhumanity: A broad term that encompasses all non-Ancient and non-Celestial species. Panhumanity is the majority population of the Celestial civilizations and their sectors. The Ancients consider panhumanity insignificant, expendable and unworthy of important service.
Primary System: Ancients actually inhabit these systems. Maybe not actually on a planet, but they are present in the system.
Sector. An area of space 1000x1000x1000 light years across. There are ~7800 sectors in the Verse. A sector contains 10x10x10 (1000) subsectors.
Subsector. An area of space 100x100x100 light years across. Each subsector usually contains 1-3 conduits running through it.  
Thrall: A broad term for all non-Ancient species that willingly serve the Ancients. Many of them have been created by the Ancients. There is always a hierarchy amongst thrall species.
Wormhole: Space based Precursor constructs that allow instantaneous travel to another wormhole. Travel requires a key which is specific to an origin-destination route.  

## Tech Levels

The technology level (TL) is not constant throughout the Verse. The most powerful factions are quite advanced TL5+. While most of the worlds under the control of the despotic Ancients are TL2 while the thralls that control those worlds possess TL4 tech. There are five levels and their steps are taken from Stars Without Number from Sine Nomine Publishing.

Tech Level 0: neolithic technology
Tech Level 1: medieval technology
Tech Level 2: early Industrial Age technology
Tech Level 3: modern technology
Primitive fission power and nuclear weapons
Computers and modern-era telecommunications
Primitive intra-system spaceflight
Tech Level 4: interstellar technology
Costly but feasible creation of interstellar starships
Basic gravity control with large, heavy devices
Many things contain Virtual Intelligences (VI) - not true sentient AI, but it could fool you
Varying degrees of cyberware development
Basic genetic manipulation of humans and other life
Limited organ, limb, and tissue cloning
Starship or small-building-sized fusion power plants
Energy projection weapons of various kinds
Tech Level 5: galactic scale technology
Achievable creation of True AIs
Omnipresent VI
Gravity manipulation via small-scale devices
Instintaneous point–to-point transportation via gates
Devices with inexhaustible internal power sources
Sophisticated, fine-tuned force field creation
Nanotechnology at several different scales of effect
Gear can take any form
Transhumanism - body swapping and tailor maid bodies
Functional immortality treatments

## Magic

Magic is a unique term in the Verse. Much of the Precursor and TL5 tech is so advanced, miniaturized, and integrated that it would appear to be magic to TL3 and below. However, in general Celestials rely on technology, while Ancients rely on arcane, “magical” processes.

### Celestial Magic

Celestials and those adopted may become a magic user by getting imprinted with esoteric circuitry and obtaining an arcane VI. A Celestial magic user always has domains (fire, time, healing, weather, etc) that they specialize in, and they focus on cantrips (simple, direct effects) and thaumaturgy (skilled, spontaneous shaping of unique effects). Those with circuitry can freely swap cantrips and given time they can modify, or change, their VI and thus change the domains that they have access to.
Every Celestial culture has a set of domains that they favor.
Archilects: Cosmic, Earth, Law, Lightning, Robot, Magnetism, Technology
Archons: Command, Earth, Force, Health, Law, Light, Weapons
Elysians: Animal, Fire, Luck, Plant, Journeying/Speed, Water, Weather
Solari: Cosmic, Dimensional, Health, Light, Magic, Psionics, Time

### Ancient Magic

Ancient magic is far more alien and primal. Ancients can twist reality to their whim through secret learned formulae and because their alien physiology is able to channel the other-dimensional energies required to power the effect. Thus, in order to use Ancient magic, a user must have had their physiology altered by the Ancients. Because of its nature, Ancient magic is often very taxing for non Ancients.
Ancient magic is generally spell based - the user knows mental formulae to produce specific effects. A user takes time to bind the energy through the formulae and they can then release the prepared spell at a further time. As long as the individual has spellcasting potential, they can cast any spell that they can learn the formulae to.

### Independents

Celestial tech and Ancient spellcasting have proliferated the Verse, so all of the psychics, sorcerers, wizards - all of their class - that exist can trace their abilities to one of those two sources.
Ascendancy: They shun magic in favor of hand-held tech. They have reverse engineered Celestial esoteric-tech with some success. They have only managed to recreate cantrips, and they don’t use cybernetics. They create magitech imprinted with specific cantrips.  
Collective: One of their founding members were former Ancient slaves and they possess spellcasting potential. The other has had long relations with the Solari and many have gained use of their tech.
Dominion: They have the same views and capabilities as the Ascendancy. They call their magitech “relics” which are almost always in the hands of their elite Immortals.
Mazani: Only two clans have spellcasting potential; the majority view magic with suspicion.  
Venar: As they were former Ancient slaves, many of their people have spellcasting potential.

## Travel

The Celestials and Ancients use a galaxy spanning network of wormholes to travel the galaxy quickly. Each wormhole is linked to a handful of other wormholes and allows instantaneous travel between the two. Believed to be a construct of the Precursors, the wormholes require an exotic cosmic energy “key” to activate, and the key is different for every origin-destination route. The routes and their keys are jealously guarded secrets.

For shorter travel, Celestials and Ancients rely on gates that they have built. A gate is a more limited version of a wormhole - they allow instantaneous travel between it and another gate. Generally gates from the different factions are not compatible. Most gates have a range of 100 to 200 light years, so a long distance journey requires many hops. Both terrestrial and space based gates exist. Most Ancient gate travel is detrimental to panhumanity - extensive use will cause mutation and drive most insane.  

When gates aren’t available, the population of the Verse relies on hyperspace ships. Architects and Xsur are masters of hyperspace travel - their small craft can easily achieve a speed of 20-160 light years per day (cross a subsector in 5 days). The rest of the Celestials and Ancients can manage ~10 light years per day, while most Neutral Faction (TL 4) craft can only manage ~5  light years per day. For all craft, the speed drops as the mass of the ship increases.

To achieve greater speed, hyperspace travelers must find and use conduits. They are a network of hyperspace currents that enables FTL travel that is 10 to 100 times faster than standard. The conduits are naturally occurring but also change and shift just like ocean currents. To aid in travel, the Archilects and Xsur have built countless waystations throughout the Verse. Waystations are like magnets for conduits and a number will flow towards and away from them. The closer one is to a waystation, and the more powerful the waystation, the greater the FTL speed of the conduit.

A major waystation will always have conduits connecting it to the major waystations closest to it. A sector will have 5-20 major waystations (but not all will be known and operational - due to one reason or another). Around half of the subsectors will have a minor waystation - these connect to the closest major waystation and to the closest minor waystations. Half of these minor waystations will be known and functional.

The Archilects also operate Slingshots within their most important subsectors. They can shoot a ship through hyperspace, in any direction, at 2000 light years per hour, but that speed drops in half for every 1000 light years traveled.
