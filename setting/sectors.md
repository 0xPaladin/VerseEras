# The Verse Galaxy

The Verse is roughly 100,000 light years (ly) in diameter but only 1,000 ly thick at spiral arms (10,000 at the center bulge). It contains 200 - 500 billion stars and just as many planets. The major factions divide the galaxy into 1000 light-year cubic sectors and further divide sectors into 100 light-year cubic subsectors.

Rough statistics for the Verse:
Sector Count: 7854
Subsector Count: 7,854,000
Sector Star Count: 25 - 64 million
Subsector Star Count: 25,000 - 64,000
Habitable Worlds per Subsector: 25-250

## Sectors, Subsectors and Systems

### Valid Claims

* Ancient (30%): Xothian*, Gray Syndicate, Echani Reach, Hegemony, Mi-Go Primacy
* Celestial (10%): Archilect, Archon, Elysian, Solari
* Independent (10%): Ascendancy, Collective, Dominion, Mazani, Venar
* Unclaimed (50%)

*For Xothian claims, must also generate the Avatar.

### Core Systems

It isn't feasable to generate every system in a sector. Only generate core systems - the number varies by how integral/populated the sector is to the owning faction.

There will be 20-100 core systems in claimed sectors and half that in unclaimed sectors. In a claimed sector, these will always belong to the claiming factions. In an unclaimed sector:

* 30% of the systems will have an Ancient settlement.
  * 10% will be primary systems.
  * 90% will be managed systems.
* 5% of the systems will have 2+ Ancient settlements. They may or may not know about each other, but they are not in open conflict.
* 5% of the systems will be in open conflict between 2-3 Ancient factions.
* 10% of the systems will have a Celestial settlement.
* 10% of the systems will have a feral/independent settlement and a Celestial “guardian”.
* 40% of the systems will have a feral/independent settlement.

In Ancient claimed sectors, core systems will always be primary systems. Ancient/Celestial systems will have gates - each system will link to the other core systems closest to it (as long as they within ~200 ly). Gates may be terrestrial or space based. Randomly determine the number of major waystations in the sector and place them in the core systems.  

### Random (Non-Core) Systems

If you need to create a random new system (non-core) for an adventure site use the guidlines below.

#### Ancient Faction Sector

* 30% of the systems will have a claiming faction settlement.
  * 20% will be primary systems.
  * 80% will be managed systems.
* 5% of the systems will have a claiming faction settlement, but another Ancient will be secretly present.
* 5% of the systems will be in open conflict between the claiming faction and another Ancient.
* 5% of the systems will have 1-2 independent Ancient settlements.
* 5% of the systems will have a feral settlement.
* 5% of the systems will have a secret Celestial settlement.

* 5% of the systems will have an Ancient settlement.
* 50% of the systems will be empty or have a random outpost (Celestial, Ancient or Independent).

#### Unclaimed Sectors

* 20% of the systems will have a random Ancient settlement.
  * 10% will be primary systems.
  * 90% will be managed systems.
* 5% of the systems will have 2+ random Ancient settlements. They may or may not know about each other, but they are not in open conflict.
* 5% of the systems will be in open conflict between 2-3 Ancient factions.
* 5% of the systems will have a random Celestial settlement.
