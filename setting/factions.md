# Factions

The greatest powers of the Verse are the Celestials and the Ancients who have been in a cold war for over 210,000 years. They are all highly advanced societies with technology that is indistinguishable from magic (SWN, TL5). There are five major factions amongst the Ancients: the Xothians, Gray, Echani, Hegemony, and Mi-Go Primacy. They all claim large swaths of space: 30% of the galaxy. The Hegemony, Xothians, and Primacy care about expanding their sphere of influence, while the rest are either static or strategic.
There are four major factions amongst the Celestials: Archilects, Archons, Elysians, and the Solari. The Celestials don’t care as much about territory - many just roam the Verse in titanic capitals - and they only directly claim 10% of the galaxy. But their sphere of influence is much larger than their inhabited systems.
Numerous other Celestial and Ancient peoples exist. Some have established their own factions, and the greatest of these claim a couple sectors, but most operate independently. Of the Ancients, a few are dominators that will claim a few systems as their own. However, most are scourges that rove from system to system to prey upon unprotected worlds.
None of the Ancients trust each other, espionage and proxy wars are common, and their ships/forces will attack each other if there is a plausible cause. Things are better amongst the Celestials there is peace between all of them and the Archons, Elysians and Solari regularly work together against larger Ancient threats.
Every Ancient is an utterly alien species that has little regard for any life form except their own. Even those who cooperate within the greater factions (like the Hegemony and Gray) usually live apart and keep to their own kind. All Ancients practice slavery of other “lesser” sentient species. Among these species there will be a hierarchy of alien “thrall” peoples that serve willingly. There are many reasons they will serve, like being genetically designed to do so, brainwashed, or they’re simply power hungry and want to work up the hierarchy. Thralls still serve their masters, but their rank in the hierarchy gains them more freedoms and perks.
While Ancients individually possess advanced (TL 5) technology, they keep it to themselves and they restrict their thralls to TL 4 tech. Ancients maintain small scale “forges” that produce personal gear, and they rely on thrall and slave labor to manufacture and build everything else.  
Celestials were panhuman once but fully embraced transhuman existence. Technology is so advanced, prevalent and interwoven within their societies that it is “invisible” allowing most to live idyllic, anachronistic lives. Every individual exists in a perfectly born body, but they may have many different body forms throughout their effectively immortal lives. And each faction has its own common body forms that set them apart from the others. The celestial population is a lot smaller than that of the Ancients and panhumanity in general.
Outside of Celestials and Ancients, many independent factions exist. Most of these are not as technologically advanced as the major factions (TL 4). The greatest are the Ascendancy, Collective, Dominion, Mazani, and the Venar. As a whole they claim 10% of the galaxy. The Ancients prey upon the independents and they have no reservations about wiping out or “harvesting” entire systems. While the Celestials don’t interfere directly with the independents, they may meddle to varying degrees, and they regularly come to the aid of systems facing an Ancient threat.
Amongst the Ancient and their thralls, panhumanity is treated below thrall status and considered barely above animals. This means life is often brutal and short and their settlements rarely possess technology beyond the medieval period. But this hubris also works to panhumanity’s advantage, allowing them to surprise their overlords when they plot and work against them.
The Celestials always protect (and shepherd) any free panhuman systems that they come across. Since these systems are almost always former Ancient colonies the Celestials will usually establish an outpost (or multiple) on the world to clean up any remaining Ancient presence. Practicing uplift is frowned upon by general Celestial society so these outposts try to limit their contact with the locals, but they aren't going to hide. And over the many millenia numerous panhumans have immigrated to Celestial settlements where they have thrived and created a unique subculture within Celestial society.  

## Major Factions

**Archilects.** Celestial. Networked. Efficient. Constructive. Cosmic AI Primarchs govern sprawling forge worlds where artificial life and cyborg devotees pursue perfect design. Their factory complexes span subsectors, building orbitals and waystations with mathematical precision. They are the galaxy's architects, transforming raw matter into megastructures.

**Archons.** Celestial. Righteous. Militant. Lawful. Self-appointed guardians who wage war against Ancient tyranny with unwavering conviction. Their strict moral code and military discipline make them paragons of virtue and justice. They fight to protect the innocent, though their inflexibility sometimes alienates more chaotic allies.

**Elysians.** Celestial. Free. Passionate. Spontaneous. Nomadic Celestials who roam the Verse in small groups, valuing personal freedom above all. They gather at impromptu festivals before scattering again like leaves on cosmic winds. When Ancients threaten the defenseless, these wandering heroes rise to fight.

**Solari.** Celestial. Wise. Protective. Mysterious. An egalitarian alliance organized by role rather than rank, speaking in metaphors and aphorisms. They oppose Ancient threats while respecting free will, never forcing their vision on others. Their mysterious nature masks a deep commitment to goodness without dogma.

**Hegemony.** Ancient. Secretive. Hierarchical. Expansionist. A collection of Ancient nation-states ruled by the enigmatic Midnight Council of cosmics. Their priests enforce worship and crush dissent across vast territories. Crysik gates and Rhukothi flesh factories sustain their empire of subjugation.

The following Ancients make up the majority of the Hegemony:
Crysik: They create most of the gates and manage large scale interstellar transportation.
Echani: They specialize in research, arcane study, and they build and maintain great repositories of Ancient knowledge.
Rhukothi: Devout worshippers of the Empress Arachne who they say is part of the Council. A foundational member of the Hegemony. They are the spies, secret police and enforcers of the Midnight Council. Masters of fleshcrafting, they also manage farm worlds and their flesh factories create most of the soldiers and warships for the Hegemony.  
Uzollru: They rule the oceans of Hegemony worlds.
Xsur: They gather and refine resources from terrestrial worlds and deep space. Their titanic factory cities harness the power from gas giants for large scale manufacturing.

The Hegemony and Xothians have been locked in a cold war for over 38 millenia. The Xothians refuse to venerate anyone but themselves, and regularly squash all Midnight Cults that they find within their demesne. Neither openly attack, but they do everything they can to undermine the other. The Hegemony routinely plants Midnight Cults trying to sway fringe systems, while the Xothians push hostile neutrals into Hegemony space and often hire mercenaries to perform fringe raids.

**Gray Syndicate.** Ancient. Opportunistic. Ruthless. Neutral. Mercantile. A conglomerate that trades everything—information, resources, people—to all sides without prejudice. Their farm-worlds harvest sentient beings as products for the highest bidder. One of their specialties is Super-soldier “daemon” mercenaries. War is profit, and they'll sell to anyone to keep conflicts burning.

**Echani Reach.** Ancient. Scholarly. Wandering. Archival. Ancient seekers who roam the Verse in city-ships, hunting Precursor ruins and lost knowledge. Their scattered archive-ships form a loose alliance across defended sectors. They value secrets and relics above territorial expansion.

**Mi-go Primacy.** Ancient. Lawful. Defensive. Expansionist. United Mi-go nations that combine regimented order with aggressive territorial claims. They've warred with Xothians for twelve millennia, refusing subjugation. Their devil thralls enforce borders and wage war while they seek Precursor technology for survival.

**Xothians.** Ancient. Primal. Feral. Dominating. Avatars of the cosmic entity Xothi, each believing themselves its purest manifestation. They spawn plagues of lesser creatures that match the avatar—dragons, orcs, undead—to conquer subsector after subsector. Worlds that resist are sacrificed in cataclysmic rituals to feed their cosmic progenitor.

Xothi has birthed countless avatars over the eons, but they usually take on one of the following aspects:
Tiamat, the Mother of Wyrms. Births dragons of all forms, wyrms, wyverns, and serpent-people.
Gruumsh, the Orc-Father. Leads hordes of barbarians. They capture “worthy” warriors who they force to drink the blood of Gruumsh which turns them into one of the horde.  
Apocrys, the Queen of the Swarm. Spawns giant, mutant bugs like ants, wasps, beetles, etc.
Maglubiyet, the Goblin High Chief. Releases vast hordes of small, animalistic goblins. Many have arcane elemental qualities.
Orcus, the Lord of the Undead. Raises armies of undead and empowers lich-kings to lead them.
Dagon, the Master of the Deep Abyss. Spawns fish-people, demon-rays, mutant crustaceans, levithans and kraken.
Wendigo, the Spirit of the Black Woods. Turns acolytes into lycanthropes, mutates flora, and leads the beasts themselves to prey upon the “civilized” world.
Nurgle, the Prince of Plagues. Spawns giant vermin - rodents, flies, mosquitos - and mutates people into plague bearing, rodent or vermin hybrids.
The Xothians have been locked in a war with the Hegemony for over 38 millenia and with the Mi-go for 12 millenia. The Hegemony is anathema to them and viewed as their ultimate foe, while they simply want to crush and dominate the Mi-go. They buy mercenaries from the Gray, relics from the Echani, and they regularly use the lesser factions as their pawns as they scheme to out maneuver the Hegemony.
