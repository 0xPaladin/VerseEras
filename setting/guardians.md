# Guardians

The Guardians are a small scale reconnaissance, defense, and first response force that opposes Ancient incursions into both Celestial and neutral systems. The Solari established the Guardians over 90,000 years ago, and their operations are a national priority for the Solari.

They function more like the CIA than a military organization. There are four main directorates: Analysis, Operations, Science and Technology, and Support. There are three active divisions within Operations:

Rangers: Squadrons that rove throughout the Verse looking for signs of Ancient activity. They catalog new neutral systems, unsecured Ancient ruins, and uncover/respond to Ancient incursions.
Delvers: Teams assigned to secure, contain, and neutralize any threats that remain in abandoned Ancient sites.  
Lightbringer: Operatives sent to feral and managed Ancient systems.  Either to topple lingering thrall tyrants, or help establish panhuman independence by supporting guerilla cells working to gain the system’s freedom.
The Solari started the Guardians, but any Celestial may join their ranks. Currently 30% of the Guardians are Solari, 30% come from the Archons, 20% are Archilects, 15% are Elysians, and 5% are other.

## Patrol Zone

Subsectors without a Celestial presence leaves the scattered panhuman civilizations, colonies, and outposts vulnerable to Ancient and pirate threats. Guardians are assigned to a Patrol Zone (usually a slice of a sector, 1000 x 1000 x 100 ly). They can be found anywhere in the Verse, but they are usually sent to unclaimed sectors.

## Characters

Guardians are gifted with the best tech that the Celestials have to offer. Tech so advanced the results are indistinguishable from magic. Every culture has a set of “power” themes that they favor. When creating a character some aspect of their abilities should link to one of their culture’s themes.

Archilects: Cosmic, Earth, Law, Lightning, Robot, Magnetism, Technology
Archons: Command, Earth, Force, Health, Law, Light, Weapons
Elysians: Animal, Fire, Luck, Plant, Journeying/Speed, Water, Weather
Solari: Cosmic, Dimensional, Health, Light, Magic, Psionics, Time

### Naming

The Archons, Elysians, and Solari will have “regular” firstnames. But their last names will be in the tradition of the Sioux Peoples: Adjective + Noun. The “meaning” of the Adjective + Noun should align with their culture’s themes.

A Solari name could be: Natasha Silver Dawn

Archilect names are in the form of Adjective-Noun-###. The Adjective-Noun will align with their culture’s themes. ### is a random three character alphanumeric: A47, 7R6, 0WT, etc.

An Archilect name could be: Charged-Epsilon-1T7
