# Generate Species

## Celestial/Independent Species

When generating a character, Celestial or Independent, or an enslaved species on an Ancient world you can use the following generators. When creating a species you will only need to generate a body form. But if you are creating a specific character you can generate a random society origin, and background to define their potential knowledge, expertise and talents.

Origins and Backgrounds come from Uncharted Worlds and Far Beyond Humanity by Sean Gomes.
Form

Humanoid (55%). Humanoids have the standard human body shape: two legs, two arms, torso and a head.
Variations: cyborg, hologram, size, minor physical feature, major animal features, living vegetation, magical/elemental
Animal (15%). You have an animal shape. Your body does not have to conform exactly. Your size can be influenced by your form. Same variations as humanoids.

Alien (10%). Your form is completely alien to most other forms of galactic life. Your nature and your ways are known only to you and your kind.
