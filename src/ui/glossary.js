            <div class="mv1">
                <b>AI.</b> Artificial Intelligence. Super advanced computer programs that enable the manipulation of dust to
                create supernatural effects.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Capitals.</b> Great interstellar craft that - at a minimum - haul hundreds of people and thousands of tons
                of cargo. Size is not a factor, capitals hundreds of miles long swim through space like interstellar
                whales. Capitals can cross the Verse in a couple of months.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1"> 
                <b>Conduits.</b> A network of hyperspace currents that allows for FTL travel that is 10 to 100 times faster
                than standard.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Cosmics.</b> Planetary system scale AIs that manage / control most of the factions and thus the Verse to
                some extent. Their cores are secreted away in space-time constructs, highly guarded, and they often
                possess numerous copies.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Domain.</b> A territory under the guardianship, and perhaps directly controlled, by a singular Cosmic. May
                encompass a number of star systems connected by gates, but minimally one world.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1"><b>Dust.</b> Everpresent nano-machines that enable the fantastic super-science.</div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Gate.</b> These devices allow instantaneous travel between it and another place. The great stellar gates
                enable ships to travel between linked systems. However, there are countless gates scattered across
                worlds only big enough for a few people to walk through shoulder to shoulder. Most are secret or
                forgotten and require a key.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Hopper.</b> Spaceships used for intrasystem travel. They cannot leave a system, but they can travel between
                worlds in under 20 minutes.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Hyperspace.</b> The standard method of faster than light (FTL) travel. The mass of a ship increases the
                energy required to remain in hyperspace, so the larger the ship the slower it can go.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Jumpship.</b> Spaceships capable of quick interstellar travel. Most are equivalent to planes. The biggest
                may have four or five decent rooms and a cargo bay. Most can achieve a FTL speed of ~25 light years per
                day. Using conduits, these craft can cross the whole Verse in a couple weeks.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1"><b>Outlands.</b> The collective term for all the ungoverned star systems outside the Cosmicsâ€™ Domains.</div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Outsiders.</b> Life within the borders of the major factions is pleasant, but danger lurks outside. Pirates,
                crime syndicates, space beasts, ravaging swarms, and conquering powers - collectively known as Outsiders
                - constantly search for systems to prey upon.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Sector.</b> An area of space 1000x1000x1000 light years across. There are ~7800 sectors in the Verse. A
                sector contains 10x10x10 (1000) subsectors.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Subsector.</b> An area of space 100x100x100 light years across. Each subsector usually contains 1-3 conduits
                running through it.
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Pantheon.</b> A group of allied Cosmics. All of their Domains are collectively called a Realm (ex. Elysium
                is a Realm controlled by the Elysium Pantheon).
            </div>
            <div class="mv1">
                <b>Wanderer.</b> Augmented beings far beyond galactic standard - though they might not even remember or
                recognize it. Galactic vagabonds - they have a mixed past and their future is unwritten. They are held
                in awe and fear by most of the galaxy. Few can stand against them and little can stop them. They can
                unlock the true potential within relics and may bind dust controlling AIs to gain supernatural
                abilities.
