<h1>Factions</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                There isn’t one government throughout the Verse but a great number of factions that vary in how they
                govern (dominate) their populace. They guide the course of history and influence the current fiction. As
                long as you are not running a galaxy at war game, assume the galaxy is in balance, with factions pushing
                and pulling against each other until their relations have hit some kind of equilibrium. Every useful
                resource within the galaxy is under some faction's sway.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the current era, the Free League (<span class="light-blue">∎</span>) guards roughly a quarter of the galaxy, while the Architects
                (<span class="yellow">∎</span>), Dominion (<span class="orange">∎</span>), and Red Dawn (<span class="red">∎</span>) each claim a sixth of it. Which leaves a quarter of the Verse as the
                Outlands (<span class="gray">∎</span>) - a lawless expanse in the hands of the Ancient, AI, and Outsider factions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Free League and Architects are composed of smaller factions that are led by a Pantheon of Cosmics
                and all the systems under their control are called a Realm. The systems of a realm are noncontiguous -
                they are not necessarily near each other thanks to the presence of conduits and gates.
            </p>
            <div>Factions are split up into the following three basic categories:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Threats</b> will attack on site and without mercy. There is no negotiating with them. And unless
                    a special alliance has been made a Threat will attack all other factions as well. All Outsiders are
                    Threats.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Allies</b> will work openly with the Wanderer’s. They will allow them in their space freely and
                    the PCs can come and go as they chose. Allies will usually cooperate with each other and oppose
                    Threats.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Neutrals</b> are open to working with the PCs, but on a limited basis. If the Wanderer’s get
                    permission Neutrals will allow them in their space but usually only to designated worlds and under
                    the conditions of the permission. Neutrals are most concerned with their own plans.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Archons</h3>
                <div class="b i">Free League, good/lawful, ally</div>
                <p>A militant order dedicated to protecting the League and finding and fighting threats like the AI or Outsiders. They are ruled by seven Thrones and their realm is called Celestia. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Curators</h3>
                <div class="b i">Architects, neutral, neutral</div>
                <p>Organic life is imperfect - it is up to them to perfect it. Curators manage numerous farm-worlds and orbitals, stocked with all forms of life - from people to simple farm products. Each farm is ordered and has its own unique set of variables, built as a galactic design of experiments to “perfect” organic life. Most inhabitants don’t even realize that they are part of a great experiment. Their Realm is Gehenna.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Deep-Dwellers </h3>
                <div class="b i">Ancient, evil, threat</div>
                <p> Malign, deep-ocean dwelling, radially symmetric, fish-like monstrosities that have powerful psychic abilities. They were one of the strongest Ancient factions/empires but now they hide in the depths and dream about the past. They resent all humanoid life and actively seek ways to undermine and wreak havoc on the worlds that they inhabit. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">

                <p> A relentless conquering empire of clones and cyborgs under the totalitarian rule of the Immortal Nine. They seek to unite the Verse under the perfection of their design. Their Realm is Avernus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">False Gods/Tyrants</h3>
                <div class="b i">Architects, varies, varies</div>
                <p>Countless despotic Cosmics that rule over systems like ancient gods and feudal kings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Free Union</h3>
                <div class="b i">Free League, good, ally</div>
                <p>A loose union of benevolent Cosmics. Hard to unite under one cause, but powerful together. A wide array of peoples and cultures. Their Realm is Arcadia. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Forgeworlds</h3>
                <div class="b i">Free League, lawful, ally</div>
                <p>Small planet-sized capitals led by a Primarch. They roam the Verse looking for resources to rebuild and repair the mega-infrastructure of the galaxy: orbitals, gates, tachyon stations and the like. Each Forgeworld focuses on one aspect of the “Great Machine.” Their Realm - all of the gate connected Forgeworlds - is called Mechanus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Gemeli</h3>
                <div class="b i">Free League, neutral, neutral</div>
                <p> An Ancient/uplifted culture that defied the odds and became a synergistic union. They now operate as a conglomerate that specializes in asteroid, gas giant, deep space and exotic materials mining.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Guardians</h3>
                <div class="b i">Free League, good, ally</div>
                <p>An order dedicated to fostering peace, healing the hurt, and protecting those in danger. There is a militant arm that opposes Outsider incursions, but they focus on rescue, evacuation, and slowing the threat. Elysium is their realm, but they claim few systems and most live on mobile capitals. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Hegemony </h3>
                <div class="b i">Ancient, evil, threat</div>
                <p> Ancient alien powers that lurk and inhabit the black depths of space between stars and beyond the edge of the galaxy. Led by sentient fungoid “Brain Collectors” they view all other forms of life as inferior. While they may conquer a system from time to time they usually just occupy it for a short period as part of some greater inscrutable goal and then disappear again. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Hordes </h3>
                <div class="b i">Outsiders, evil/chaotic, threat</div>
                <p>Unique ravager Cosmics that have a lust for violence, conquest, and dominance above all else. They lead vast armies of dust-forms like the hordes from history. Each horde goes through cycles of dormancy where they linger in systems to strip worlds bare and conquest where they travel as a whole to new systems to fight, win and repeat the cycle or die.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Houses of the Sun</h3>
                <div class="b i">Free League, good/chaotic, ally</div>
                <p>Egalitarian, advanced, but aloof from most of the Verse. Their realm is Arborea, but they like to keep the locations of their systems, capitals and orbitals secretive. They try to guide the course of the Verse through diplomacy and negotiation. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Ikaryans </h3>
                <div class="b i">Free League, Ancient, neutral, neutral</div>
                <p>A large collection of different fungal lifeforms that lives individually but thinks [very eccentrically] as a gestalt. The Agari are the best known mobile Ikarya that interact with the Verse populace. They usually live on small enclaves on habitable worlds where they establish a mycorrhizal network to connect with the greater link. They view themselves as historians and keepers of lost lore and are willing to help outsiders, at least those that can decipher their often quizzical answers. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Lyns </h3>
                <div class="b i">AI, chaotic, threat</div>
                <p>The most dangerous mesh of AI, dust and genetic engineering to be unleashed upon the galaxy. Lyns are hordes of semi-sentient predatory dinosaur-bug bio-weapons driven by AI Overlord monarchs. Their warrens infest worlds, releasing plagues of their kind as the mutant-dust slowly warps and twists the landscape.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Myr </h3>
                <div class="b i">Architects, neutral, neutral/threat</div>
                <p>Sorcerer-kings who tirelessly hunt ancient relics to increase their own power. Each builds a unique and private retinue of Wanderers and an army of mercenaries to serve them.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Protectorate </h3>
                <div class="b i">Free League, good, ally/neutral</div>
                <p>The greatest act is creation. Their Cosmics are terraformers and protectors of life on all worlds. They roam the Verse in their great capitals looking for worlds to shape and places to establish species that were lost to the cataclysm of the AI/Cosmic War. Their realm is known as the Wilds or the Beastlands and no one is allowed to build on their worlds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Reapers</h3>

                <p>A number of hive minded armies that are collectively obsessed with the destruction of all humanoid life.  They systematically travel from system to system and wipe out all life leaving barren worlds. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Red Dawn</h3>
                <div class="b i">Red Dawn, neutral, neutral/threat</div>
                <p>Imperials ruled by seven major houses through an orderly succession of emperors. The houses are always looking to annex “weak” systems into their fold and vying for power amongst themselves. Their realm is Acheron.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Syndicates</h3>

                <p>Galaxy spanning criminal organizations. Some act like families, while others are secret organizations. The greatest syndicates are: Shadowsteel, Rukhothi, The Circle, and The Gray.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="mv1 ph2">
                <h3 class="ma0">Worms </h3>
                <div class="b i">Ancient, evil, threat</div>
                <p>Giant, worm-like Ancients with amazing powers to shape/warp reality that view all other forms of life as their tools. Each is a despotic megalomaniac that wants to carve out its own stellar empire - they almost never work together. They use/groom promising “subjects” to implant with their spawn which gives the individual amazing powers but ultimately results in their death or transformation.</p>
