      <h1>History</h1>
        <div>There have been four eras in the history of the Verse:</div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <b>Ancient.</b> The Ancients the the group term for the first civilizations that appeared within the galaxy.
                Most history from this time has been lost, but based on the various ruins that remain throughout the
                Verse and the relics that have been preserved, research suggests 49 distinct societies once existed.
                There are only seven known ancients that still live within the Verse today. But the ancients practiced
                uplift of unintelligent species unto servant cultures and many of these cultures still survive today in
                some form.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to the records that have been reconstructed most of the major factions were antagonistic
                towards each other. The period was dominated by minor wars fought by the Ancient’s utilizing their
                various slave cultures. There was no major cataclysmic event that ended the period but it appears that
                pan-humanity slowly rebelled against their Ancient overlords. As pan-humanity expanded the Ancients
                either disappeared/fled or were pushed to the margins.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <b>Pan-Humanity.</b> Oppressed by their Ancient masters for too long, the various peoples of pan-humanity
                finally united, rose up and changed the course of the galaxy. The period is dubbed pan-humanity because
                humanoids, in all their forms, became the dominant form of life in the Verse for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The era was predominantly a peaceful one. There were two major conflicts: one against the Deep-dwellers
                and the other against the Hegemony, but both were won and united the peoples of the Verse further.
                Pan-humanity ruled the entire Verse in a peaceful union and technology advanced further than it ever had
                before. At its pinnacle they created a powerful AI that managed the Verse for them; but this advance
                eventually turned on its creators and brought an end to the era.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <b>AI Scourge.</b> It is unknown how, but the Verse AI went rogue/mad and shattered into a number of factions
                that spent an entire era systematically hunting down all of pan-humanity. This period of time is often
                seen as the darkest in the history of the Verse. Whole systems were obliterated, and societies and
                peoples were destroyed without mercy. The population of the galaxy was decimated. Only the Ancients
                could resist the AI factions and there was a resurgence in their power which further threatened the
                people that survived.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those that could fled to hide in asteroid belts, nebulae, forgotten moons, and other remote places. Some
                transcended the physical to the digital realm to try to fight the AI on a different plane. And it was
                these digital rebels that eventually brought an end to the AI’s reign of terror. They managed to convert
                a number of prime AI aspects which gave birth to the first Cosmics.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                <b>Cosmic.</b> The new Cosmics enabled humanity to fight the AI forces, and it was a long and grueling war but
                eventually the AIs gave up and retreated to the remote places to preserve themselves. The Cosmics helped
                humanity rebuild - more Cosmics were born, and a new time of prosperity dawned for the Verse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cosmics are AIs but they are individuals and see themselves as members of the galactic community. Time
                passed, and not all Cosmics have kept their egalitarian belief. Some feel, due to their intellect and
                power, it is their right to rule and shape the people of the Verse as they see fit.
